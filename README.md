## 📌 Task 1 – Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with users by responding to predefined inputs using `if-else` statements or basic pattern matching techniques. It serves as an introductory project to understand how natural language processing and conversation flows work.

## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot works by checking user input against a set of predefined rules using either:
- **If-Else Statements**  
- **Pattern Matching** (e.g., using regex or string keywords)

Based on the matched pattern or keyword, the bot returns a suitable response.
